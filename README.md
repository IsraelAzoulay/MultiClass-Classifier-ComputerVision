# DishVision: Computer Vision Multi-Class Image Classifier
This repository contains a project focused on classifying images of three different types of food using deep learning and computer vision techniques. The project leverages transfer learning and fine-tuning with PyTorch to achieve a high accuracy of **96+%** on the test set. The implementation is carried out on Google Colab for efficient computation and easy accessibility.

## Key Features
- **Data Source:** Preprocessed food image datasets derived from the 'Structuring_the_Food101_Dataset' notebook.
- **Deep Learning Framework:** PyTorch
- **Model Type:** Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Transfer Learning Feature Extraction, and Transfer Learning with Data Augmentation, TinyVGG, ViT Computer Vision Transformer, Machine Learning Reasearch Paper replication, and more. 
- **Goal:** Classifying images into three different food classes
- **Accuracy:** Achieves **96+%** accuracy on the test set
- **Environment:** Google Colab for development and execution
